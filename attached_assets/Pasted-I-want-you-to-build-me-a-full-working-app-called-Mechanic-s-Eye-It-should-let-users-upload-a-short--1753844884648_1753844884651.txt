I want you to build me a full working app called Mechanic’s Eye.
It should let users upload a short video and/or sound clip andor be able to feel the vibrations and/or for the user to explain in their own words of their car making a weird noise, and not working for what ever reason and then the app will try to detect what the problem is based on info collected from any source that would be precollected in its data bases of noises vibrations motions and explanations of what and why a vehicle has broken down.
The user should see a simple mobile interface where they can upload the sound clip, video clip, a segment of vibrations, and a small paragraph of what the vehicle is doing in their own words click submit.
Then the backend should analyze the clips, match it to a known clips of sounds vibrations pic or video and /or a description of what the vehicle is doing , and show the user a likely diagnosis with a confidence score. it should also have 2 other alt. scinerios that could be affecting the vehicle
The app should run in what ever is best suited for a mobile app of this significance and robustness the front end and backend needs to be set up to run on mabile primarily but it will alo have a web based version to give a well rtounded ability to use this product as pros utilize laptops as their scanning tool using forscan  and let me test the whole thing inside Replit.
You can use mock detection logic for now, but set it up so that ondce it is tested and it works well on the test version the the internet is scraped for all the possible trouble codes from a obdII detection. all possible sinerios of a vehicle breaking down should be held in a data base this includes but is not limited to all the detectable sounds, pics, videos, and explanations and diagnoised answers that have came from all these examples of vehicle failure.  all this info should be rated 1-10 in viability as far as knowledge, validity of diagnoisis (if there was a solution with the problem that was discovered in the scrape this is a 10 FOR VALIDITY) ONCE THAT HAPPENS ONLY A LEVEL 8 OR ABOVE WILL BE ADDED TO THIS DATA BASE THE AI THAT IS INVOLVED WITH DIAGNOISEING THESE PROBLEMS SHOULD BE LEARNING IN REAL TIME ABOUT THE DIAGNOSING AND FIXING OF VEHICLES. OR ANYTHING TO DEAL WOITH WORKING WITH THE DIFFERENT HUMAN TYPES THAT WILL BE USING THE APP WE ARE LOOKING FOR A SUCCESS RATE OF FIXING THE PROBLEM OF 98.9999%  
I want it all in one project that runs clean. No unnecessary files. Just give me what I need for it to work.
